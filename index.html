    <h1>My IIT Bombay Journey</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="block">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Indu - undergraduate student at IIT Bombay, pursuing Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS). My journey so far has been a vibrant blend of academics, campus exploration, hostel life, and personal growth.

While rooted in a core engineering field, I’m passionate about coding, data science, and web development — areas where I can combine creativity with logic. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new tools, think critically, and build with purpose.

I’m constantly looking to grow through new experiences, meaningful collaborations, and opportunities that allow me to make an impact while evolving both technically and personally.</p>

    <h2>Hostel & Campus Life</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Hostel Life</h3>
        <p>Hostel life at IIT Bombay has been one of the most memorable and defining parts of my journey so far. Living in a close-knit community, I’ve experienced the energy of late-night study sessions, spontaneous conversations in corridors, and the unmatched spirit of hostel fests. It’s a space where friendships are formed over shared meals, weekend chai breaks, and endless laughter. Beyond academics, hostel life has taught me independence, time management, and the joy of living among a diverse and vibrant group of peers. It’s not just where I stay — it’s where I’ve grown, learned, and made memories that I’ll carry with me long after IITB.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Campus Vibes</h3>
        <p>The campus of IIT Bombay has a unique energy — a blend of academic intensity, creative expression, and natural beauty. From peaceful lakeside walks and green open spaces to the buzzing activity around lecture halls, labs, and student hubs, the environment is both inspiring and refreshing. Whether it’s participating in tech events, cultural festivals, or simply exploring the campus with friends, every day feels full of possibility. The vibrant mix of ideas, people, and passions makes the campus more than just a place to study — it’s a space to grow, connect, and thrive.</p>

  <section id="academics" class="block">
    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p> My academic journey in the MEMS department has helped me build a strong foundation in engineering and materials science. I’ve complemented this with hands-on experiences like the XLR8 RC Plane project, which enhanced my practical skills and teamwork.

A key highlight was my industry visit to Sterlite Industries, where I got exposure to real-world manufacturing processes and large-scale industrial operations. Observing fiber-optic production and sustainable practices firsthand deepened my interest in how materials engineering is applied in industry..</p>

  <section id="growth" class="block">
    <h2>Learning & Growth</h2>
    <p> I’m currently focused on learning coding and expanding my skills in Python, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MATLAB, alongside exploring data analysis and core MEMS concepts. The learning goes beyond academics — it’s also about building consistency, discipline, and confidence. Whether it’s developing a website, analyzing datasets, or deepening technical understanding, every step is contributing to both academic and personal growth. </p>
